The landloard may be able to claim additional sums from you if you do not pay by the date specified in this notice. You have the right to challenge the reasonableness of any additional sums at a leasehold valuation tribunal. Section 167 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 and regulations made under it prevent your landloard from forfeiting your lease for non-payment of rent, service charges or administration charges (or a combination of them) if the amount owed is Â£350 or less, or none of the unpaid amount has been outstanding for more than three years.
