  - cloud server uses terraform and updates /etc/hosts
    sudo bin/run -a -d
      - create cloud server
       -a - apply without destroying
       -d - development server
  - local server requires install with checklist
    - See "Server Setup below" - the cannonical version is
      kept in Evernote Adams Letting Checklist / Server Setup
