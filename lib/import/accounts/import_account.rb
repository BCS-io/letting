  # ImportAccount
  #
  # Wraps around an account item - which is read in from the imported
  # legacy file acc_items (account items). ImportBase is responsible
  # for the generic calls and ImportAccount uses Charge, ImportDebit and
  # ImportPayment to wrap up the data.
  #
  # Charge is called when a new (mostly) debit is seen for the first time.
  # Debit is called when the account is to be debited by a charge.
  # Credit is called when the account is to be credited by a charge
