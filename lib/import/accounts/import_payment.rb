  # ImportPayment
  #
  # Creates payments and builds associated credits from row file data.
  #
  # ImportPayment consumes account information, acc_items.csv, and
  # produces database records.
  #
  # Account process begins with ImportAccount, which contains both
  # opening balances, credits and debits, and this filters the row
  # into their bookkeeping taxonomy and feeds it to the appropriate
  # objects. ImportPayment is responsible for credits and will
  # create a payment and a credit from a row of file data.
