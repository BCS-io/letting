  # The headings for each column of the appropriate data file mapped to

  # The import process begins with FileImport which opens files and
  # converts them into arrays. When opening the file the columns are
  # mapped to the headers supplied to FileImport by calls to this class.
  #
  # import_XXX files such as import_client - reads in a row of data at a time.
  # The client then assigns it's attributes by deferencing the array with a
  # symbol the same name as the attributes.
