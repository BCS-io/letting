  #
  # Imports users into the application.
  #
  # The source code is freely available on the internet. We require that
  # user information is private and not kept with the source code.
  # The user information is kept in a CSV file.
  #
  # The code is run only during the import process.
  #
  # CSV was chosen because the system uses it for all the other database
  # tables already.
