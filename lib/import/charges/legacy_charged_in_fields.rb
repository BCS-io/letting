  # Provides the chargedIn value from supplied charge fields.

  # The charge import process takes rows of acc_info.csv and creates database
  # rows in the charges table. This objects takes fields from charge_row and
  # converts them into the ChargedInIds. There are a number of rules
  # used by the legacy application to decide this and this objects wraps them
  # up.
