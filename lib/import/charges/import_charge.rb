  # ImportCharge
  #
  # Load, assigns and saves Charge model objects into the database
  #
  # ImportCharge is called as part of the import.rake task. It reads in a
  # charge.csv file (called acc_info.csv) and creates the charge objects and
  # saves them to charges and due_ons tables.
  #
  # ImportCharge has model_prepared and model_assignment called
  # by ImportBase as part of its import_loop. The private code handles
  # converting the charge.csv into charges (the actual amount) and due_ons
  # (the date when the charge is due).
  #
  # ChargeRow - wrap up the ruby csv row and converts the raw values into
  #             values and identifiers which the program uses.
