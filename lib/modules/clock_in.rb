# ClockIn
#
# Recording information to the nearest possible accuracy.
#
# We are using this to register datetimes when we may not know the actual time.
#
# If we are recording time there are 3 possibilities.
# We are recording a datetime that is today - we keep this faithfully.
# We are recording a datetime in the past - we only know the date and
#   make this the last thing that occurred on that day.
# We are recording a datetime in the future - we only know the date and
#   we make this the first thing that occurred on that day.
