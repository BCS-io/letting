# Restful actions on the Payments resource
#
# Payments resource covers crediting the debits that the tennats are
# charged by the debt generator / invoicing system.
#
# Payments are operator generated resources. When a payment is recieved
# (by standing order or cheque) - it is entered into the system through
# this resource.
#
# Payments are associated with credits which offset the debt_generator's
# debits.
