# Restful actions on the Payments resource
#
# Payments resource covers crediting the debits that the tenants are
# charged by the debt, invoicing, system.
#
# Payments are operator generated resources. When a payment is received
# (by standing order or cheque) - it is entered into the system through
# this resource.
#
# Payments are associated with credits which offset the invoiced debits.
