# Credit
#
# Generated by payments and linked to a debit. The credit offsets
# a debit charged to a property account.
#
#
# A payment is applied to one property account. When being applied
# it finds unpaid debits and generates a matching credit.
# The credits get set during the payments controller #create action.
