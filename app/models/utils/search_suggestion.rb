# SearchSuggestion
#
# Provides suggestions while filling in forms
#
# Suggestions are created by running rake search_suggestions:index
# This calls the index_properties method which adds items ....
#
# Adds autosuggestion to forms - see properties.js.coffee.
# Code from Railscasts - not fully hooked up - requires indexing
# which needs to be automated.
