# Advance & arrears
# Advance and arrears - gets dates turns them into periods
# indexes the period on either the start or end date
#
# FixedTerm
# * periods cannot be calculated from the repeat_dates
# * Use Repeat_dates to find matching periods.
#
# How to get period information from persistent store
# 1) fixed_term table with id and up to 4 columns for dates to match on
# 2) fixed_term_period with:
#      - FK - fixed_term table foreign key
#      - due_date - date which the charge becomes debited.
#      - period, two dates, which is associated with the due_date
#
# When you query you have a billed_date and it matches the due_date
# This returns the periods.
