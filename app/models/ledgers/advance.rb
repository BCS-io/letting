# Advance
#
# Returns a period given a date within
#
# RangeCycle is the factory for billing range objects such as Advance and
# arrears.
#
# Initialize takes the repeated dates and calculates the period ranges from
# this - example 25th Mar and 30th Sep would result in two periods.
# 1) 25th Mar - 29th Sep
# 2) 30th Sep - 24th Mar of next year.
#
# As it stands: Ranges match on the date the bill becomes due. With advance
# this means the start, or first, date of a range - it then builds up the
# range and returns this to the caller.
#
# A useless assignment which increases human reader's comprehension.
