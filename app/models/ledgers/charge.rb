# A charge that is applied to a property's account.
#
# A charge represents the type, amount and, through due_ons, the date that
# a property should become due a charge.
#
# The code is part of the charge system in the accounts. Charges are
# associated with a property's account. When an operator decides they want to
# bill a group of properties. Charges are generated according to this
# information using the invoicing system. The information is passed, as a
# chargeable, to becomes a debit in the property's account.debits
