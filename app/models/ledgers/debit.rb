# Debit
#
# Why does this class exist?
#
# It represents an item of debit held under a property's account.
#
# How does it fit in to the larger system?
#
# Properties have charges which become due. The act of become due is to
# generate debits for a charge on a particular date - it then sits against
# the property's account. Credits made by tenants offset these debits.
#
# When a charge is being generated the generation system checks against when
# the debit became due to see if the property has already been charged against
# for this time period.
#
# Debits increase an accounts balance +.
