# FirstRunMaker
#
# Makes invoices given invoicing, comments and date arguments.
#
# FirstRunMaker takes invoicing information and other associated information
# and creates invoices.
#
# Run requires the invoices and makes a call to objects that create invoices
# for it. The first run is a special case and is responsible for creating
# invoices from user supplied arguments(account_range and time period) as well
# as invoice_date and comments.
