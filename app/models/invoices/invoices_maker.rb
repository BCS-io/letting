# InvoicesMaker
#
# Makes invoices given invoicing, invoice_date and comments.
#
# InvoicesMaker takes invoicing information and other associated information
# and creates invoices for the matching accounts.
#
# Run requires the invoices and makes a call to objects that create invoices
# for it. This is responsible for creating invoices from user supplied
# arguments(account_range and time period) as well as invoice_date and comments.
#
# property     - the property to invoice
# invoice_date - the date which the invoice is dated on
#                affects the date which the arrears balance is created for.
# comments     - information string to be applied to the invoice.
