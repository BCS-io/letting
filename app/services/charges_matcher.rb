# ChargesMatcher
#
# Matching only needed during the import process
#
# This is a service object for Charges it allows a charge to match
# an imported charge. Matching import charges should not be the concern
# of the Charge object. The import process will happen until the migration
# to the new system is complete - the import code is then retired.
